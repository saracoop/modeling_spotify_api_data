I started this project because I was interested in the relationship between an album and its cover art. A record's cover plays a massive role in categorizing and 
placing an artist's work into a musical context. The artwork serves as a meaningful visual representation of sound and gives the listener an idea of what to 
expect. The imagery is an opportunity to make a great first impression and show a bit of the musician that lies behind. I would go as far as to say the imagery 
can potentially affect a listener's perception of the music. I believe that music is a multi-sensory experience, and an album's image can invoke all kinds of 
feelings and emotions. This relationship leads to the idea of aesthetics as an essential factor for music discovery. Visual information may improve the efficiency 
of the search process; it takes a lot less time browsing through a collection of images than listening to clips of songs, and the aesthetics of the multi-sensory 
experience.
