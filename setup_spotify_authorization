Spotify allows users to access their web API for free, but you will need to register a Spotify app. 
This process is super easy and fast, and you can sign up using this link: https://developer.spotify.com/

Once you have done that, go to the developer dashboard and click on 'Create an App.' 
You can go ahead and add a name, don't worry about details, this will pretty much be a placeholder.

I use the Spotify python library spotipy for my code: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.12.0/#

Authorization requires you to set up a token: spotify = spotipy.Spotify(auth = token).
The token requires 5 parameters: a username, scope, client_id, client_secret_id, and a redirect_uri.

The username is just your Spotify login username. 
The scope is relatively unimportant for this project, so you can use the default one I put in my code.
If you are interested in learning more, you can check it out using this link: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/
The client id and client secret id come from the app you created earlier. Once you have clicked into the app, you will find them
both in the panel under your app's name.
To access the Spotify API, you need permission from a least one user, luckily that user can be yourself; this is where the redirect URI comes in.
You need to provide a link within your app; it doesn't have to be a proper link so you can use the default link I put in my code.
To add the link, click on 'Edit Settings' and add the link under 'Redirect URIs.'

Now you have all you need to fill in the credentials from the code.

One thing to note, if you are not running all the code at once, the access token has an expiration period. (typically around an hour)
Spotify provides a refresh token, so if your original token expires, you can rerun the #set up authorization lines, and your app will request a new one.
